Reading List - Integrating Alexa with Spring
============================================
This repository contains three distinct projects that together
demonstrate how to integrate Alexa with a Spring API:

 - **auth-server** : A Spring authorization server.
 - **books-api** : A Spring-based API for managing a simple reading list.
 - **reading-list-skill** : A Node.js-based Alexa skill that consumes the books API and uses account linking to gain authorization for secured endpoints on the API.

See each individual project's README for details on running and using them. The README for reading-list-skill describes how to use all projects in concert together.
